# 🚀 Employee Salary Prediction System – IBM Cloud Internship Project

This project was developed as part of the **IBM SkillsBuild Virtual Internship Program**, in collaboration with **Edunet Foundation**. It showcases a complete machine learning pipeline built and deployed using **IBM Cloud (Watsonx.ai / Watson Studio)**.

## 📌 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a system that predicts **employee salaries** based on various input features such as experience, education, role, location, and more.

This was done entirely on IBM Cloud using its tools for data science, model development, and collaboration.
